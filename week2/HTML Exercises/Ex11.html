        <h2>Heading 2</h2>
		<p>A heading is a short phrase describing what the succeeding section is all about. You can think of it as the title of that particular section.</p>
        <p>Short documents usually do not require the use of headings. For theses and other complex readings, however, headings are important because they help readers identify the main points of each section in the paper.</p>
